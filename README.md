## Overview

### Description

This app allows the client to see the movements of his/her cash.
Enter the following details of the clients:

```
user - ky, pin - 1111 for the client Karlygash Yakiyayeva;
user - vp, pin - 2222 for the client Venera Pshanova;
```

to see their cash movements.\
Also, in this app the client can loan money from the bank and transfer money to other clients.\
Finally, one important feature of the project is that when the client is logged in, the timer will be started and logged out automatiicaly after 5 minutes in case the client is inactive. Also, the timer restarts in cases the client loans and transfers money.
